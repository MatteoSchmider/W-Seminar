<p align="justify"> There are three important symmetries in nature: 
charge (C), parity (P), and time (T). Each of these corresponds to a 
change in a particle’s state: C reverses the sign of the charge, P flips 
left-handed into right-handed, and T reverses the direction of time. 
Until the 1950s it was believed that interactions governed by all four 
of the basic forces (strong, weak, electromagnetic, gravity) were 
invariant under any of these transformations. In 1956 Yang and Lee 
reviewed previous work and found that while there was more than enough 
data to see that the strong and electromagnetic interactions obeyed P, 
it hadn’t been tested with the weak force. They proposed an experiment 
on <sup>60</sup>Co atoms that was carried out by Wu and showed that beta 
decay (governed by the weak interaction) violated P. However, the 
experiment would still be symmetric under both C and P (CP), leading 
many to believe that the laws of nature were actually invariant under CP 
and T. But if CP violation occurred in nature, it would be found in weak 
interactions.</p>

<p align="justify"> The first experimental test of CP violation came in 
1964 with the Fitch-Cronin experiment. The experiment involved particles 
called neutral K-mesons, which fortuitously have the properties needed 
to test CP. First, as mesons, they're a combination of a quark and an 
anti-quark, in this case down and antistrange, or anti-down and strange. 
Second, the two different particles have different CP values and 
different decay modes: K<sub>1</sub> has CP = 1 and decays into two 
pions; K<sub>2</sub> has CP = 1 and decays into three. Because decays 
with larger changes in mass occur more readily, the K<sub>1</sub> decay 
happens 100 times faster than the K<sub>2</sub> decay. This means that a 
sufficiently long beam of neutral Kaons will become arbitrarily pure 
K<sub>2</sub> after a sufficient amount of time.</p>

<p align="justify"> The Fitch-Cronin experiment exploits this. If all 
the K<sub>1</sub>s are allowed to decay out of a beam of mixed Kaons, 
only K<sub>2</sub> decays should be observed. If any K<sub>1</sub> 
decays are found, it means that a K<sub>2</sub> flipped to a 
K<sub>1</sub>, and the CP for the particles flipped from -1 to +1, and 
CP wasn’t conserved.</p>

<p align="justify"> Fitch and Cronin measured this using the apparatus 
shown in Fig. 1. The Kaons are sent down a 57-foot collimator, into a 
chamber of Helium. The K<sub>2</sub>'s decay in the chamber, and the 
decay products are measured in a series of detectors at the end of the 
chamber. The detectors each consist of a spark chamber to determine 
direction, a magnet/scintillator to determine mass, and a water Cerenkov 
for timing information. The goal was to find θ, the sum of the 
angles from the horizontal of two particles hitting the detectors at the 
same time. In a three-body decay, this angle will very rarely be 0, 
while in a two-body decay it will almost always be 0 (the y-components 
will be equal, and the x-components will be swamped by the relativistic 
motion in the x-direction).</p>

<p align="justify"> The results of the experiment are shown in Fig. 2. 
The experiment resulted in an excess of 45±9 events around cos(θ) 
= 1 in the correct mass range for 2-pion decays. This means that for 
every decay of K<sub>2</sub> into three pions, there are 
(2.0±0.4)×10<sup>-3</sup> decays into two pions. Because of this, 
neutral K mesons violate CP.</p>

<p align="justify"> It’s still unclear, 44 years later, why CP is 
violated is violated in weak interactions. There’s no indication of CP 
violation in any other force. However, this does have important 
implications. Before the Fitch-Cronin experiment there was no known 
interaction that treated anti-matter differently from matter, and so 
there was no explanation for Baryogenesis, the observed asymmetry 
between matter and antimatter. CP violation in the weak force provides 
the only possibility so far discovered, although exactly how the 
difference forms is still a mystery. CP violation remains an active 
research area, with experiments such as BaBar at SLAC (and other 
B-factories) exploring the extent and character of the violation more 
accurately than Fitch-Cronin, with the eventual goal of providing 
answers to these deep questions.</p>
